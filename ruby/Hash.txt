Hash

{} returns a default value of nil

Hash.new(0) returns the default value of 0

Thus if we are trying to use reduce or inject to keep count of occurrence of item in hash. 
Use Hash.new(0)

e.g. 

"happy new new year again happy".split(' ').inject({}) do |accumulator, str|
  accumulator[str] += 1
  accumulator
end

will fail because the default value is nil

"happy new new year again happy".split(' ').inject(Hash.new(0)) do |accumulator, str|
  accumulator[str] += 1
  accumulator
end

generates {happy: 2, new: 2, year: 1, again:1}, because the empty hash has a default value of 0
