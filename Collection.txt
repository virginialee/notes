Collection

In order to make a custom object part of the collection, simply include Enumerable and
implement the each method.

e.g.

class Custom
  include Enumerable
  NUMBERS = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

  def each
    NUMBERS.each { |n| yield n if block_given? }
  end
end

numbers = Custom.new
numbers.each { |n| p n }

By mixin Enumerable we get reduce, inject, select for FREE~!
